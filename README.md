<h1>Welcome to Influence, our final project for the coding bootcamp The Hacking Project</h1>
<h2>What is this ?</h2>
This is a mock Ruby on Rails app we made as our final project for the coding bootcamp The Hacking Project. It is an online platform for online influencers and freelances to meet and accelerate their careers.
<h2>How do I test it ?</h2>
Just download the repository, unzip it, navigate to it inside your terminal, then execute <code>bundle install</code>, <code>rails db:create</code>, <code>rails db:migrate</code>, <code>rails db:seed</code>, and finally, <code>rails s</code>. Then navigate to <a href="localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a> in your web browser.
Alternatively, you can directly test it online at <a href="http://influence-thp.herokuapp.com/">this <strong>Heroku</strong></a> address.
