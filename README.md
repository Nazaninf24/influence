<h1>Welcome to Influence, our final project for the coding bootcamp The Hacking Project</h1>
<h2>What is this ?</h2>
This is a mock Ruby on Rails app we made as our final project for the coding bootcamp The Hacking Project. It is an online platform for online influencers and freelances to meet and accelerate their careers. It features the use of various tools such as search filters and card based indexes to make the UX and the matchmaking as smooth as possible.
<h2>Major features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://bootswatch.com/lux/">Bootswatch theme</a> integration</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan">Cancancan gem</a> integration to easily handle user permissions</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack">Ransack gem</a> integration to generate a simple search filter used to enhance the UX</li>
  <li>Two types of user dashboards that allows the users to simply manage their ongoing projects, or the adverts they have created & one admin dashboard</li>
</ul>  
<h2>How do I test it ?(localhost and Heroku)</h2>
Just download the repository, unzip it, navigate to it inside your terminal, then execute <code>bundle install</code>, <code>rails db:create</code>, <code>rails db:migrate</code>, <code>rails db:seed</code>, and finally, <code>rails s</code>. Then navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a> in your web browser.
Alternatively, you can directly test it online at <a href="http://influence-thp.herokuapp.com/">this <strong>Heroku</strong></a> address.
